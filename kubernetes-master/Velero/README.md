## Overview

Velero (formerly Heptio Ark) gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. You can run Velero with a public cloud platform or on-premises. Velero lets you:
```
   Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
   Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
   Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.
```
Velero consists of:
```
   A server that runs on your cluster
   A command-line client that runs locally
```
